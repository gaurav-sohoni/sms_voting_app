Voting App README:

Environment requirements:
rails: 3.0.9
mysql2: 0.2.11

Setup:
rake db:create - creates mig_voting_development database
rake db:migrate - creates the tables as per migrations in db/migrate
rake import:data - import vote data into the database from votes.txt log file

Running the rails app as 'rails s' should run it on port 3000.

1) localhost:3000 - lists all the campaigns imported
2) Clicking on Show details shows the campaign details:
	a) campaign name
	b) candidates with their score (valid votes)
	c) invalid vote count (depending on validity)

Description:

For keeping the application and data simple and clear, three main data models
were created.

1) vote
2) campaign
3) candidate

Vote model is the most important entity and serves two purposes:
1) it holds the voting data
2) it acts as a join model between campaign and candidate

So using the join model vote, we can find the candidates for a given campaign and thus can
calculate valid and invalid votes.

Every vote belongs to a candidate and a campaign. Votes with valid validity 
(validity = 'during') are considered for campaign score. Invalid votes are calculated
per campaign depending upon their invalid validity.

Script for loading the log file data into database is the rake file under lib/tasks/ named import.rake
On command line, running rake import:data imports the data into the database.
